Glue is an ActionScript 3 library that enables communication between Flash and Arduino boards. 
It can be used to connect sensors (such as rotary encoders and motion dectectors), actuators (such as LEDs and motors) 
and other electronics (such as RFID readers) to Flash, Flex and Air applications. 
The library includes Arduino and ActionScript code examples as well as redistributions of Arduino firmware and a serial proxy.
