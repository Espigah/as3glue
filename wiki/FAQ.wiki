#summary Frequently Asked Questions

*Q:* I need more information. 

*A:* 

Read the [http://code.google.com/p/as3glue/wiki/Reference Reference] and the [http://code.google.com/p/as3glue/wiki/Instructions Instructions]. Also have a look at the documentation at [http://protolab.pbwiki.com/FirmataAndFlash protolab].

*Q:* 

The serial proxy sees a connection but I can't send/receive data to/from the Arduino.

*A:* 

1. Make sure you are connecting to the port your Arduino is on (check serproxy.cfg). 

2. Double check that the baud setting in serproxy.cfg and Standard_Firmata.pde is the same. Data will be scrambled and no events will be triggered if the settings differ. The default baud rate in the Standard_Firmata Arduino firmware is at the time of writing 57600. The baud rate in the firmware and serproxy.cfg example that is  redistributed with as3Glue is also 57600. If you don't use the included Standard_Firmata.pde or serproxy.cfg example then you might need to change the settings. There is some confusion surrounding different versions of the Firmata firmware. It will hopefully sort itself out soon.  

3. Make sure that newlines_to_nils=false in serproxy.cfg. If it is set to true then the serial proxy will convert the "new lines" ascii character (0a in hexadecimal, 10 in decimal) to 0. 

*Q:* I can't get serial proxy configured correctly.

*A:* 

OS X: Some people using Intel Macs are [http://protolab.pbwiki.com/Arduino2Flash reportedly] unable to get serproxy configured correctly. Try using [http://protolab.pbwiki.com/Arduino2Flash Arduino2Flash] instead of serialProxy.

Windows: Try [http://tinker.it/now/2007/06/03/new-tinkerproxy-for-windows tinkerProxy].
