*Q:* 

The serial proxy finds the Arduino but I can't send receive data from Flash.

*A:* 

Make sure you are connecting to the port your Arduino is on (check serproxy.cfg). 

Make sure that the baud setting in serproxy.cfg and Pd_firmware.pde is the same. The default is 115200. data will be scrambled and no events will be triggered if the baud settings differ . 

Make sure that newlines_to_nils=false in serproxy.cfg.
