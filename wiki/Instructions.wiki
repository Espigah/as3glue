= Introduction =

How to interface an Arduino board from Flash/Flex/AIR applications using the Arduino class in as3glue.

= Details =

1. Upload Pd_firmware.pde (or one of the other included Arduino sketches) to the Arduino board.

2. Set up a serialProxy to enable Flash to communicate with the Arduino via a socket connection (a sample config file for serialProxy is included in the library).

3. Instantiate an Arduino object using the port that you set up in (2).

4. Register event listeners for incoming Arduino data (see the included examples). 

5. Read and write to the Arduino using functions similar to those in the Arduino reference (see the included examples).
