= Introduction =

How to interface an Arduino board from Flash/Flex/AIR applications using the Arduino class in as3glue.

= Details =

1. Upload Standard_Firmata.pde (or one of the other included Arduino sketches) to the Arduino board. If you are using another version than Arduino 0010 you also need to install the Firmata library by putting the Firmata folder in the Arduino hardware\libraries folder.

2. Configure and start serialProxy to enable Flash to communicate with the Arduino via a socket connection. A sample config file for serialProxy is included in the library.

3. Instantiate an Arduino object using the port that you set up in (2).

4. Register event listeners for incoming Arduino data (see the SimpleIO example). 

5. Read and write to the Arduino using functions similar to those in the Arduino reference (see the SimpleIO example).

6. For more information see the [http://code.google.com/p/as3glue/wiki/Reference reference],  [http://code.google.com/p/as3glue/wiki/FAQ FAQ] and the included SimpleIO example.
